<h3>Matt started Geauga PC out of his home in 2009 in Munson Ohio. After spending 13 years working in the tech industry as an IT Consultant and LAN Administrator he had a vision to provide superior service at a fair price.
When not helping our clients with their technology needs he has volunteered his time as past president of the Chardon Chamber of Commerce, former trustee of the Chesterland Chamber of Commerce, member of Businesses Supporting West Geauga Schools and Chesterland Innovation Center board of advisors.  When not working or volunteering Matt enjoys watching his sonâ€™s band Amaryllis (www.AmaryllisBand.com) perform at local Cleveland establishments.</h3>
